It’s gigantic!  Started off at the Strawberry Fields area as I had visited where John Lennon used to live, but there was little to see apart from a truly awful tone-deaf busker.   So we hastily moved on and spent an hour walking around.  It’s a pretty amazing place really.  Next time we’re in NYC, we will explore more.  The horse-drawn carriages and pedicabs are very expensive and we decided not to treat ourselves this time."

There were runners, walkers, cyclists, people taking rides in the horse and trap. There were people enjoying the scenery, doing yoga, watching the birds, drawing, painting and tourists.As well as the trees and open spaces there are quite a few statues to admire as well as places to get refreshments like the Tavern on the Green.If you are a person who likes water there are a number of water features including the Bethesda fountain, the reservoir and the pool by the statues of Hans Christen Anderson and Alice In Wonderland.There really is so much to enjoy in the park and there are loads of places to sit and relax.

In the end we settled for a normal park bench but had to ward off the pigeons!We had highlighted the points of interest that we wanted to visit but walking between them is hard: there are no sign posts of any help, you have to ensure you avoid everyone else- the carriages, pedicycles,  bikes and runners, pedestrians are at the bottom of the food chain here! We tried to follow the on line map but even that wasn’t particularly helpful. In the end we resorted to Google maps. It was a lovely sunny day, the lake is pretty but there is no where you can stop and view the landscape, it’s quite hilly and feels like it is divided into segments, which makes it feel disjointed. When I visited ten years ago with my children and we followed a path away from the main points of interest in order to get to the underground station we walked into a group of down n outs which I found quite frightening. On this occasion my husband and I found ourselves wandering through the outskirts again to get to a station and even though there were a few people around it felt intimidating and unsafe. I certainly wouldn’t want to be here when it’s not complete daylight."

It probably isn't quite what many have made it out to be. When we visited there were certainly many visitors around, as well as various vendors selling things like hugely overpriced bottles of water. The park has some lovely areas to see but it also seems to be overgrown with weeds. There is a lot of greenery but it does not seem to be as well looked after as it should be.  The lack of signage is a major problem and we found it was easy to lose your way around the park. Trying to find a particular sight within the park proved to be a major issue."

Today Mamma Mia was being previewed. Once we found our table with our names we each took a seat where our names were placed. As soon as everyone sat down, the waiters were released and started taking orders from each table. After everyone's order was taken the waiters left the cinema.The movie went on when suddenly all the lights went off but one stayed on and faced a door where multiple shadows stood The shadows soon came out the final song of the movie played ""I Have a Dream"". Once the song started the actors started singing a dancing. They were all dressed like different characters. The main character soon took the stage and we realized it was Amanda Seyfried the actual actor who played in the movie. Gradually the audience started to get up from their seats and started dancing around too.In conclusion, The service was first class, With the staff ensuring your meal was perfectly timed with the movie. The menu either had food from the movie or drinks related to the movie but don't worry there were different diet options. The cinema offers other movies which I hope to see soon. This place is perfect for any event all under the price of $100 per person. Be prepared to be shocked, entertained, and just full of joy from the first scene to the final scene."

Eerie...,Jun 2023,"Went for a nice walk into the park while my son visited the zoo. It was a bit eerie on account of all the smog arising from wildfires in Canada.  Everywhere had a strange, murky orangey glow.  I liked the fact that there were hundreds of park benches everywhere and the statues of famous personalities from the past were impressive. Everywhere I went in the park was relatively quiet and peaceful. The only real recognition that it is in a huge metropolis is the distant wailing of ambulances or other emergency vehicles. And the occasional break in the trees to see the neighbouring huge skyscrapers that epitomize New York. I didn't explore the while park - it's quite big really. I only made it as far as the Bethesda Terrace. So I have a lot still to explore on future visits (hopefully)."

But it’s not clean. You will see lots of pets as well which I necessarily did not like because I am a runner and dogs got in the way. But since park is huge you can always detour and get a better running path. There are paths for joggers and bikers both. It’s good to remember which gate you came in from so you exit the same way. Else you can get lost and end up on a different street totally. Very good experience for someone who loves to run. Kids liked the playground.

Yes there's a zoo too.We did see grass in lots of sections, baseball areas, fountain, lakes, monuments (including John Lennon memorial), playground, tennis club, walking paths, bridges, bridleways and cycle paths.Our day was spent on rental bikes so we did at least manage a college circuit. There are horse drawn carriages and peddle rickshaws but they seem like a rip-off from other reviews. There were plenty of people on e bikes and scooters too as well as in foot.There are food stalls around the edges of the park though watch out for the ones that don't have a price list, it just means a nasty shock when you come to pay. I can recommend Billy's hotdog stall.It's also, in part due to its size, close to several museums and a few other sites."

We started at the southern end.   With a quick visit to the Plaza hotel.   Someone online had suggested doing the park in this order and it worked out fantasticallyOur first stop was  Gapstow  Bridge, it was beautiful with the city skyline as a gorgeous backdrop.   Woolman rink was the next stop which had an enormous number of tennis courts.  Central Park carousel was very nice.  Went down to the Mall, there is a bandshell and bunch of buskers.  We really enjoyed Bethesda terrace and the fountain with the backdrop of a lake, beautiful setting. Wagner cove has the bow bridge, a couple were getting engaged while we were there.  Strawberry fields was very nice, not what I expected Ithought it would be a huge open area but it was a treed  area very peaceful had lots of benches.  There is circle on the ground that says imagine that people get their picture taken.  There was a young lady Star span, had a great voice and sang Beatles music   By this point we were hungry and still had a good chunk of the park to go.  We went to the 72 nd street diner and split a grilled chicken sandwich.    It was amazing and best of all reasonably priced.   They had an awesome selection of foods.  Would definitely come back, wish we had a place like that back home. We stopped at the ladies pavillion to have our lunch, they had covered benches by the water and best of all there was a gentleman playing music and singing.   It was awesome.Walked through the ramble.   Then went to Belvedere castle make sure to climb the stairs to the top, it is free to get in.   Beautiful scenery from both observation decks.  Walked past the obelisk and behind the met and walked to the Guggenheim.    We did that all in 3.5 hours with some breaks to sit and have lunch.  Central Park is beautiful, so many different areas to explore.   I’m sure we just scratched the surface.   There are so many benches all over the park and many artists playing and singing scattered all over.  We saw people selling water, fruit cups and ice cream.   I was expecting to see actual food venues, maybe they are in different parts of the park that we did not go to.   So if we came back I would pick up lunch before coming into the park so that we could avoid having to leave the park to get food.  It is an amazing park that you could visit again and again.  We had no time to actually go into the museums, maybe the next time we are back."

We walked it on our way to the Natural History Museum and back. It was a decent amount of walking from our hotel in the Times Square area, but it only took us a little over half an hour and an overall easy walk there. I can totally see the appeal of visiting this park, even for us tourists.

It has over around 20 playgrounds, several man made lakes and ponds, arched bridges, and extensive paths for walking, running and biking. Truly the first thing you notice about Central Park is that it is vast. Apparently an estimated 42 million visitors enter the park every year, making it one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. My wife and I visited on the afternoon while in the area and now can understand the attraction. Really it was fantastic. The Harlem Meer was wonderful with the turtles swimming here and there, Belvedere Tower was extremely interesting, and the John Lennon tribute Strawberry Fields was touching. These were just three of many highlights of an amazing park. My wife and I really enjoyed our visit and after 4 hours of consistent walking had still only seen a small portion of this inner city wonder. New Yorkers you're so fortunate to have this joy of a park."

I took so many photos of it from the alleys of the Central Park! The park is gorgeous as ever and it was so nice to see its lush greenery in its summer best.

It’s also a lot more enclosed than I expected, I thought the vistas would be more expansive, but with the undulations, the rocks and the planting it actually creates lots of smaller spaces.

To go inside the park it was obvious the price was going to shoot up to double or treble that for more time. The park must be a great facility for locals and it’s great that a big city has such a  green resource. But if you are a tourist you may well have better parks and green spaces at home. The Imagine mosaic could do with a bit of a clean.

I even saw a bride in her dress, with her groom, having photos taken. My husband loved the Strawberry Fields area in tribute to the late, great, John Lennon.

However, what we planned was to visit the park throughout. However our time in the cherry blossoms was too much for a one-day exploration of the full park, and we had some places to go, so we only got to the lower third of the park. With that said, the cherry blossom areas were actually not as crowded at peak bloom as the other cities such as Toronto or DC. I braced for mayhem which did not materialize. Keep in mind, this was during Easter Sunday morning too, and New York is the country's largest city, so I was legitimately surprised.It was great because it was free to enjoy, the scenery is awesome. A place of peace and quiet in the middle of the largest city in the country. There were many people for sure, but they were just jogging, biking, hiking, walking, doing their physical activities. There were a lot of places to rest too with a line of benches in some areas, and rocky hills to rest as well. Just watch out for bird poop though."

Trust me, this park is full of   nostalgia for movie lovers. This park has a Woody Allen kinda vibe !We had a lovely time at this park. We took a guided tour in a bicycle cart and it was so fun. Our guide, 'Babu' was so good throughout the tour. He also gave us a $20 discount on the offer price. Nevertheless, the park is absolute joy for all kinds of visitors, toddlers, the young and the old. So many people were taking a stroll, a run or just sitting by enjoying nature's bliss. I particularly like the fountain that's at the centre of the park. The water bridge is so cool and the sight of petite boats sailing under the bridge is such a pretty sight. You'd almost always find couples getting their wedding photoshoot done here. The park is at a walking distance from a lot of other famous places in New York. We were tourists, so we definitely loved this park"

Interestingly, it’s the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 45 million visitors annually and is the most filmed location in the world.You can tap into an audio guide on your phone, just follow the sign prompts.We entered via the gate near the Guggenheim and walked through the walled grounds, following the tracks, paths and roads from one side of the park to the other. It’s delightful to see people sitting in the shade reading a book, listening to music or baking themselves in the sun. Kids playing ball or a nanny pushing the pram around with a sleepy baby. A group practising Tai Chi and a small gathering practising yoga. The multiple lakes attract the turtles, bird life and of course, people in row boats. There are plenty of spaces to stop and soak up the park, either near the paths or away from others with some privacy. There are many attractions including landscapes such as the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and Sheep Meadow. Plus amusement attractions of Central Park Carousels, Strawberry Fields Memorial for John Lennon, Wollman Rink and  Central Park Zoo. There is so much more to see, too many to list here. The Park has a diverse ecosystem with several hundred species of flora and fauna and the diversity is what makes it unique. From one end to the other it’s lovely to soak up everything the Park has to offer. You can catch a carriage and horse ride, pedicab, ride your own bike, drive or walk through the park. Many events and concerts are also held throughout the year.This is a 365 day, 24 hour a day space that changes with the time of day, the weather and the seasons.I only saw 20% and can’t wait to discover more of this amazing green space in the middle of the metropolis that is New York."

It’s huge and in hot weather there aren’t many shaded areas so sit. So plan your visit time wisely, take plenty of water although there are plenty of water fillers around the park. Expect to pay double for any snacks, drinks or ice cream you buy in the park… best to take your own food and drinks. If you cant walk a lot then you can take a ride with one of the bike rickshaw there are plenty at the start of the park."

Crowded as can be! Clean. Stay in your lane ( bikes, walkers, …). Be honest about how much time you want to spend at each site. If you want to spend a half hour at Bethesda Fountain, don’t take a tour. If you are good with a quick walk through take a tour. There are bathrooms on the stairs at Bethesda Fountain. The bathrooms weren’t the cleanest and the stall height is low. There was soap, water, toilet paper… there were steps down to the restroom. There were food trucks with water in the area. Belvedere Castle is crowded. If you have mobility issues, there is a fairly steep hill through the Shakespeare Garden and steps up to the castle. It’s not a ‘castle’ in the European sense. Keep in mind if you visit with mobility issues or strollers it’s not a flat park. I will definitely return!"
